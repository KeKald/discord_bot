# Cortana

## Installation
1. Install """pip install pipenv""".
2. Run inside the directory """pipenv install -r requirements.txt""".
3. Run inside the directory """pipenv shell""".

* """pipenv shell""" ensures that you are "logged in" to the local 
Python environment and not the global.
* On linux Ctrl + D logs you out of that environment.
* on Windows Ctrl + Z plus Enter logs you out of that environment


## Remainder
* I installed discord rewrite: py -3 -m pip install -U discord.py
